# DFIRTriage: Linux Host Triage Collector

A simple but powerful Python tool for collecting volatile and non-volatile forensic artifacts from a Linux host during an incident response investigation.

This project is being developed as part of a hands-on cybersecurity portfolio.

## 🚀 Features

* Collects critical forensic artifacts from a live Linux system.
* Uses a simple `artifact_list.json` to define what to collect.
* Packages all collected data into a single, timestamped `.tar.gz` archive.
* Logs all command successes and failures for review.

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone ...`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the collector: `sudo python collector.py`
